# Coffee Machine Project

This is a Python Coffee Machine project that simulates a coffee vending machine. Users can select from three types of coffee (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino) and pay for their coffee using multiple coin denominations. The machine also tracks resources like coffee beans, milk, and water.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** This project requires Python to be installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-machine.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd coffee-machine
   ```

4. **Run the Coffee Machine:**
   ```
   python coffee_machine.py
   ```

5. **Enjoy Your Coffee!**

## Features

- **Multiple Coffee Options:** Users can choose from three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

- **Coin Payment:** Users can pay for their coffee using multiple coin denominations (e.g., quarters, dimes, nickels).

- **Resource Tracking:** The machine keeps track of available resources, such as coffee beans, milk, and water.

- **Coffee Brewing:** The machine brews coffee and dispenses it when the user makes a selection and provides payment.

- **Change Return:** If the user pays more than the coffee's price, the machine returns change.


## Usage

1. **Select Coffee Type:** When the machine starts, it will prompt you to select your coffee type (e.g., "espresso," "latte," or "cappuccino").

2. **Insert Coins:** After selecting your coffee, you'll be prompted to insert coins with specified denominations (e.g., "quarters," "dimes," "nickels").

3. **Dispense Coffee:** If the machine has enough resources and you've paid the correct amount, it will brew your coffee and dispense it.

4. **Change Return:** If you overpay, the machine will return the change.

## Resources

The machine keeps track of the following resources:

- Coffee beans
- Milk
- Water

These resources are consumed with each coffee order, and if any resource runs out, the machine will not be able to serve that type of coffee.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the coffee machine:

1. Select "latte" as your coffee type.

2. Insert 2 quarters and 1 dime when prompted.

3. The machine will brew and dispense a latte.

4. Enjoy your coffee!
